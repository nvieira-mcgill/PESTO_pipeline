A pipeline for processing data from the Planètes Extra-Solaires en Transit et Occultations (PESTO) optical telescope located at l’Observatoire du Mont-Mégantic (OMM). 

Work on this pipeline was begun in Summer 2018 by Andy Ramirez-Côté and continued in Fall 2018 and Winter 2019 by Valérie Desharnais and Nicholas Vieira. All work was completed under the supervision of Dr. D. Haggard and the rest of the Haggard research group at McGill.
