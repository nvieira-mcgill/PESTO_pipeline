# PESTO_pipeline
A pipeline for processing data from the Planètes Extra-Solaires en Transit et Occultations (PESTO) optical telescope located at l’Observatoire du Mont-Mégantic (OMM). 

Work on this pipeline was begun in Summer 2018 by Andy Ramirez-Côté and continued from September 2018 to August 2019 by Valérie Desharnais and Nicholas Vieira. All work was completed under the supervision of Professor D. Haggard and the rest of the Haggard research group at McGill.

# Modules you'll need 
This software makes use of certain modules you may not already have. These are:

astropy -- Widely-used software for astrophysical programming. It's recommended to download the whole thing. 

pyraf -- An industry standard tool for all sorts of astrophysical programming. Used here for stacking images and applying domeflat corrections. 

photutils -- Software affiliated with astropy, used specifically for photometry. It's also recommended to download the whole thing.
