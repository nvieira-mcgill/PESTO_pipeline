A script for running the PESTO pipeline on full-frame data. It creates a stack 
of all dome flats, subtracts this stack individually from each fullframe image, 
and then stacks the full frames. The resultant reduced data file contains a WCS 
solution which can then be applied to all of the object images, provided that 
the instrument does not significantly drift during observations. 

This script was designed specifically to work with the source MAXIJ1820+070, 
but serves as an example for writing your own scripts to automate the process.
