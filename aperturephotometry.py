def photometry(header, data, name, thresh_factor, RA_bound, DEC_bound, results_file, im=True):
    """
    Input: the header of a reduced object's .fits file, the image data of the file, the name 
    to be used when creating the segmented image and a csv containing all detected sources, a 
    threshold factor to be used in image segmentation, 2 arrays giving the RA and DEC (in degrees)
    boundaries on the desired source, the name of the results textfile to which the photometry will be 
    appended, and a boolean indicating whether or not to save the image 
    of the segmentation test (optional; default is True)
    Output: None
    
    Obtains a stack of images in the form of a header and data from a .fits file. Estimates the background photon count of this 
    image. Sets a threshold above which we declare a cluster of pixels to be a source: this threshold is defined as 
    the background + the input thresh_factor*the RMS deviation of the background. 
    [Should go into more detail here, or in the README.md]
    
    Scans the input image and looks for sources which are at least 7 pixels in area and above this threshold. Saves an image 
    of the sources found in the original field to the working directory. Uses a pixel coordinate to WCS coordinate 
    transformation, via a previously known reference pixel (see PESTO_lib.WCS_preparation()) to obtain WCS coords of all 
    detected sources. Outputs a .csv containing the properties of all detected sources.
    
    A tab-delimited results file is appended to. The number of images used in the stack, the total exposure 
    time of the stack and its error, the timestamp (averaged across all images) and its error are already included.    
    IF a source is found, this script appends the x and y minima of the source's centroid, the pixel area of the source, 
    the photon count, and the error on the photon count. If not, the flag NO SOURCE FOUND is appended to the image.
